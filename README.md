#Smart Energy Management & Bill Prediction using IoT and Machine Learning

Smart Energy Management & Bill Prediction is a project that leverages IoT data and machine learning algorithms to predict electricity bills and optimize energy usage for households or industries. It helps users save energy and understand their consumption patterns.

Features

Predict monthly electricity bills based on usage patterns.

Analyze IoT energy meter data in real-time.

Visualize energy consumption trends.

Provide recommendations for reducing energy costs.

Scalable and adaptable for homes, offices, or industrial setups.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dashboards and visualizations)

Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Database: SQLite / MySQL (for storing IoT sensor readings)

IoT Integration: Simulated or real smart meter data

Deployment: Render / Railway / Heroku (Flask backend)
